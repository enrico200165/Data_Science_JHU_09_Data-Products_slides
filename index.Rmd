## Shiny Application: Simple Mtcars Plot  

- An extremely simple application using basic shiny  
  -  (despite its simplicity uses a mechanism not exaplained in the lessons neither in the standard basic shiny training 
<br /><br />
<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"  src="./assets/img/donaldduckcar.jpg">
<br />  
My Obiectives  
- use basic mechanisms of shiny
- do <b>NOT</b> develop statistic code
- Simple&quick but not quick&dirty

## Application Fuctionalities

1) Displays a scatterplot of <b>mtcars</b> data set, for any couple of variable chosen by the user.  
Shiny GUI elements are used  
- to select which are the two variables to plot (the y, the x)  
  - to control details of the plot (smooth type, if any; point size)  
<br/>
  
2) Allows to run some basic commands (names, ncol, mean ...)  
  - on the whole mtcars dataframe <b>or</b>  
  - on the selected "x" variable  
    
Commands output is shown as raw text

## Application Structure
The application is structured in 3 files  
-  The usual server.R and ui.R  
- <b>backend.R</b>  

backend.R decouples the (minimal) business logic from the GUI; it contains all and only non-GUI code.  
This basic good practise, in a real application, would allow to test the business logic on its own, independently from the GUI



--- .class #id 

## Additional Remarks

To keep together the plot options (managed by GUI widgets) a simple class was created, 
```{r setup, cache = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
setClass("plotParsClass",
  slots = c(regrSmoot = "character", pointSize = "numeric"))
plotPars = new("plotParsClass")
plotPars@pointSize <- 4 # in real app would get value from
# input$pointSize  in turn from sliderInput("pointSize", ...)
cat(plotPars@pointSize)
```

The debug messages printed to the web GUI and the automatic updating of the internal status message, was implemented using [reactiveValues()] (https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/reactiveValues.html) that gives to "normal" values properties similar to those of the GUI widgets, ie automatic update of the GUI (via the server) when a value is changed by the not by a GUI widget but by the programmer's code.
